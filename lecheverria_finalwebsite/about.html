        <h3>About Sleepy Bear</h3>
        <p>Sleepy Bear is a new online store that sells cute and silly merch! From apparel to stationary, we have a little bit of everything.
            <br>
            <br>
            The store's owner, Micaela, founded Sleepy Bear in 2020 during the height of the pandemic as a way to sell merchendise that were for future conventions that were closed down.
            <br>
            <br>
            After things started opening up again, she decided to keep on selling merch so that anyone can have the new Sleepy Bear aesthetic!
